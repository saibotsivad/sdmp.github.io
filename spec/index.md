## Roadmap

Please see the [roadmap](/roadmap) for more detailed release plans.

After a release if any issues are found that are *not* backwards
compatible, they will need to be addressed in the next release, and
they won't make it into that release.

Note also that while this specification is in `0.x` status, the
semver specs state:

> Major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development. Anything
> may change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.
